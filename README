Community Enterprise Management System ReadMe

Version 1.0.0

Semantic Personal Publishing Platform

First Things First

Welcome. Community Enterprise Management System is a fork of the popular WordPress Platform. WordPress is a very popular platform that's been used for many years to develop blogs. Our team has forked this platform to develop an Enterprise Management System. This Enterprise level platform is designed specifically for Corporations looking for a stable Content Management System for their Business Applications. 

The Community Enterprise Management System found here will be updated with stable modifications that have been tested by our Enterprise Level Customers. We offer this to the community as an Open Source platform and we encourage your participation in the development of this platform for Corporations.

Installation: Famous 5-minute install

* Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
* Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.
  * If for some reason this doesn't work, don't worry. It doesn't work on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.
  * Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.
  * Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser.
* Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="http://redrokk.com/support/" title="Community Enterprise Management System support">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.
* <strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.
* The installer should then send you to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on 'Profile' to change the password.

Updating

**Using the Automatic Updater**

If you are updating from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:

* You wanted more, perhaps? That's it!

**Updating Manually**

* Before you update anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.

**Post via Email**

You can post from an email client! To set this up go to your &quot;Writing&quot; options screen and fill in the connection details for your secret <abbr title="Post Office Protocol version 3">POP3</abbr> account. Then you need to set up <code>wp-mail.php</code> to execute periodically to check the mailbox for new posts. You can do it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a>-jobs, or if your host doesn't support it you can look into the various website-monitoring services, and make them check your <code>wp-mail.php</code> <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>.

Posting is easy: Any email sent to the address you specify will be posted, with the subject as the title. It is best to keep the address discrete. The script will <em>delete</em> emails that are successfully posted.
